Similar libraries
-----------------

Cassette took a lot inspiration from the following packages:

-  `vcrpy <https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy>`__: great library but you
   can store only one request per YAML file...
-  `vcr <https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr>`__: in Ruby

Limitations
-----------

Cassette should be considered **alpha**:

-  Only tested with ``urllib2`` and ``httplib``
-  Does not work with ``urllib`` and ``requests``
-  The format used is not compatible with ``vcr`` or ``vcrpy``
-  Only tested with Python 2.7
-  File format **WILL** change.
